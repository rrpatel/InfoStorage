Using "Search", one can search existing customers. Clicking on "Seach" button with empty text boxes 
(FirstName and LastName) will display all the existing customers into database. 
For the Testing purpose, I have inserted some Legendary customers.

Using "Register", one can add new customer information into database. 
Using iPad or iPhone (upon clicking "Browse"), one can take snapshot of ID and put that onto server.

Once you have customer's information, by clicking on "Proceed", one can proceed to checkout.
